At various intervals, I was interested in different areas of development, initially, I was engaged exclusively in frontend development. I was looking for a job as a frontend developer and  I got an internship in Mentalstack. There I decided to switch to backend development, and to my surprise, I liked the backend development much more. Unluckily, employment in Russia was suspended. So now I'm looking forward to new job opportunities.",
